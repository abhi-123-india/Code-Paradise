# Code-Paradise
Its some of my fun code, I am completely against Not invented here syndrome, but some things I could not locate easily or I had developed and could be helpful to others as a seed are published here.
1. The programs were developed when I was learning scala, so finess of language use is lacking.
2. The programs were not developed with eye on performance and I am aware, that lot of thingts can be improved.

The programs published are.

1. Sudoku solver with back tracking. It does not ensure the satifiability of smaller internal squere matrices (e.g. the 9 internal sqaures of 3x3 in a 9x9 matrix. The upside is that , the program can work with sudoku of any size.

2. A small interpreter which is at the draft level, could be useful as a starting point.
